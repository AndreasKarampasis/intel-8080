## Intel 8080 Technical Specifications

- Working registers: The 8080 provides the programmer with an 8-bit *accumulator* and six additional 8-bit *registers*. These seven working registers are numbered and referenced via the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7; by convetion, these registers may also be accessed bia the letters B, C, D, E, H, L and A (for the accumulator), respectively.
- Memory: intel 8080 can access *64KB* (65,536 bytes) of memory.
- A 16-bit *program counter*, called PC, and whose contents indicate the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- A 16-bit *stack pointer* (SP), which maintains the address of the next available stack location in memory.
